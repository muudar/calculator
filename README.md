# calculator


## Info: 

This project is a mini-calculator made with **HTML** , **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It only does the basic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division) but It's erorr free!

It shows floating and negative numbers if the answer is one, but you can't enter them in your operations directly (yet?),  However you can use fractions by division for floating point numbers, and 0 - (your number) to get a negative number.





##### This project belongs to The Odin Project course curriculum and was only made to train my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, it's nothing serious and portofolio-worthy unless I do any updates to it in the future and make it a scientific calculator
